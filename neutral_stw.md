Dear colleagues,

we have just returned from the Open Access Ambassador conference and we
want to spread the word.


 - Open Access is growing fast
 - the scientific community can benefit from Open Access
 - MPG and many funders encourage and appreciate Open Access publishing


However, one should be aware of concerns about Open Access publishing, as Open Access

 - deviates from established ways of measuring quality and significance of a paper
 - is still developing its structures and appearances
 - in some models means to 'pay for publishing' 


So, what to do? **Get informed about Open Access!**


Get back to us for any answer or opinion,
