Dear colleagues,

I have just returned from the Open Access Ambassador conference and I
want to spread the word.

 - Open Access is growing fast
 - the scientific community can benefit from Open Access
 - MPG and many funders encourage and appreciate Open Access publishing

However, one should be aware of concerns about Open Access publishing, as Open Access

 - deviates from established ways of measuring quality and significance of a paper
 - is still developing its structures and appearances

So, what to do? **Get informed about Open Access!**

Get back to me for any answer or opinion,
Jan
