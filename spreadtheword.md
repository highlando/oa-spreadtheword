Dear colleagues,

I have just returned from the Open Access Ambassador conference and I
want to spread the word.

 - Open Access is growing fast
 - Open Access is publishing in the time of the internet
 - every scientific community will benefit from Open Access
 - Open Access will take over and the sooner the better
 - MPG and many funders encourage and appreciate Open Access publishing
 - there is a strong initiative *DORA* pushing for alternative metrics for measuring scientific quality and impact

However, and also this was common sense, every early career researcher
should be aware of concerns about Open Access, as Open Access publishing

 - does not fit well the *impact factor* which plays a prominent role in assessing scientific work
 - is not broadly acknowledged for meeting *high scientific standards*
 - is still evolving 

So, hear the message and

 - get informed about Open Access - you may benefit immediately
 - go for Open Access (if you can) - it is to the benefit of everyone.


Get back to me for any answer or opinion,
Jan
