Dear colleagues,

I have just returned from the Open Access Ambassador conference and I
want to spread the word.

 - Open Access is growing fast
 - Open Access is publishing in the time of the internet
 - every scientific community will benefit from Open Access
 - Open Access will take over and the sooner the better
 - MPG and many funders encourage and appreciate Open Access publishing


However, and also this was common sense, every early career researcher
should be aware of that his scientific abilities may well be assessed by
the formula

   `academic merits = Sum of ( Publication  x  Journal Impact Factor )`

that is taylored to the established way of publishing.


So, hear the message and

 - get informed about Open Access - you may benefit immediately
 - go for Open Access (if you can) - it is to the benefit of everyone.


Get back to me for any answer or opinion,
Jan
