Open Access publishing in its most basic form is
---

 - free accessibility of a publication under a proper license


Open Access can be much more like
---

 - immediate visibility, citability upon submission
 - open and multi-level review process
 - versioning of the paper
 - impact metrics based on citations, downloads, accesses, mentions in social media 


And it can be less
---

 - Open in a restricted definition - like read only, no print outs, no copy and paste
 - Open with the copyright transferred to the publisher
 - Open after a wait phase of 1-2 years


*Open Access is highly encouraged, supported, and appreciated by the Max
Planck Society.*

The Max Planck Digital Library wants to 'make Open Access publishing as easy as possible for Max Planck authors' by maintaining, among others,
